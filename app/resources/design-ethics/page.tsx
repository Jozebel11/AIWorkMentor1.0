            <CardTitle className="text-2xl">Why AI Design Ethics Matter</CardTitle>
            <CardDescription>
              Responsible AI usage protects your reputation and the design profession

            <p>
              As AI tools become more powerful and prevalent in design, ethical considerations 
              become increasingly important. This isn't just about following rulesâ€”it's about 
              maintaining the integrity of the design profession, respecting the rights of others, 
              and building sustainable practices that benefit everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethical AI usage in design helps build trust with clients, protects against legal 
              issues, and ensures that AI enhances rather than undermines the creative industry. 
              By following these guidelines, you can harness AI's power responsibly.
